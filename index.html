                The Apollo program was intended to land humans on the Moon and safely return them to Earth. This goal was met by six missions (Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17). Apollos 7 and 9 were Earth orbiting missions that tested the Command and Lunar Modules but returned no lunar data. While orbiting the Moon, Apollos 8 and 10 tested various components and returned photographs of the lunar surface. Due to a malfunction, Apollo 13 did not land on the Moon, but it did return photographs. The six Moon missions returned a wealth of scientific data as well as nearly 400 kilograms of lunar samples. Soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismic, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind experiments were among the experiments conducted.

            The Apollo mission included a Command Module (CM) and a Lunar Module (LM).
            Following lunar orbit insertion, the CM and LM would separate. One crew member would remain in the CM, 
            which would orbit the Moon, while the other two astronauts would descend to the lunar surface in the LM. 
            The astronauts would return to the CM for the journey back to Earth after exploring the surface, setting 
            up experiments, taking pictures, collecting rock samples, and so on.

        Apollo 7 was the Apollo spacecraft's first crewed flight, with astronauts Walter Schirra, Jr., 
        Donn Eisele, and Walter Cunningham aboard. The primary goals of the Earth orbiting mission were 
        to demonstrate the performance of the Command and Service Module (CSM), crew, launch vehicle, and 
        mission support facilities, as well as the CSM rendezvous capability. There were two photographic 
        experiments and three medical experiments planned.

        A launch vehicle development test was conducted using Saturn I (SA-5). It was the fifth 
        Saturn rocket flight and the first of the Block II Saturn. It was also the first 
        time the LOX/LH2 fueled second stage flew in real time (S-IV). There were over 11,000 measurements taken.

        This was the Saturn 1 launch vehicle's first flight test. The unmanned suborbital flight 
        used a Saturn 1 first stage to transport water-filled dummy upper stages to an altitude of 
        136.5 km and a distance of 345.7 km. The mission was successful in verifying the aerodynamic 
        and structural design of the Saturn 1 booster.
